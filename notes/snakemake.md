## Using lambda functions inside rules

Listed below are some of my examples that used lambda for conditional situations.

1. Uses lambda to define input file needed depending on wildcard 'data_source'
```
rule extract_by_chr:
    input:
        lambda wildcards: str(EXAC_RAW_PATH / "ExAC.r1.sites.vep.vcf.gz") \
            if (wildcards.data_source.lower()=='exac') \
            else \
            str(GNOMAD_RAW_PATH / "exomes"/ "gnomad.exomes.r2.0.1.sites.vcf.gz")
    output:
        "{path}/split_by_chr/{data_source}_raw_chr_{chr_no}.vcf.gz"
    shell:
        "..."
```

2.  Uses lambda to choose the parameter flag required
```
rule extract_Adjusted_AC_AN_exac:
    output:
        str("extract_AC_AN/{filter_used}" / "11_table.tsv.gz")
    params:
        filter_parameter = lambda wildcards: '--remove-filtered-all' if wildcards.filter_used=='pass'  else ''
    shell:
        "..."
```


## Using dictionary with wildcards as keys
```
input:
    bams = lambda wildcards: dict_name[wildcards.sample]
```


## `zip` with >2 wildcards
Use multiple `expand`. Example:
```
expand(expand(
    ANALYSIS + "/{sample_g}_vs_{sample_t}/Stelka/results/variants/somatic.{{typevar}}_Filtered",
            zip, sample_g=GERMLINE, sample_t=TUMOR), 
            typevar=TYPEVAR)
```

## Using bash script that sends its own job in a snakemake rule

Let's say `script.sh` sends its own job to a cluster. To use this script in a snakemake rule, use `-K` flag with `bsub` in that shell script and then use `wait` command in snakemake rule.

```
rule xxx:
    shell:
        """
        ./script.sh  &
        wait
        """
```


## Sourcing `.bashrc` as part of shell command in snakemake rule
```set +u; source /path/to/.bashrc; set -u```
